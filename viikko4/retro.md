# Retro techniques

A retrospective is a meeting held by the team at the end of each sprint, where successes and failures are discussed.

## Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel
This technique uses a wheel where team members can assess how they did using 5 categories.
A circle is drawn and divided into 5 sections with the 5 words written in the title. Everyone is free to write their comments into each section.
These comments include: things we should start doing, things we should stop doing, things we should continue doing, things we should do more of, and things we should do less of.

## Glad, Sad, Mad
This technique involves the team members discussing problems, changes, or general observations they noticed during the sprint.
They will all be categorized as positive(glad), negative(sad), or problem situation(mad). The problem situations can also involved greater issues that don't have to do with the team in particular.
